0.0 --> 2.3
 This is a robot farmer.

2
3.6000000000000005 --> 9.46
 Until recently, building a robot with the same capability has been almost science fiction.

3
10.06 --> 13.62
 We came to the UK to see a robot that can do something totally new.

4
14.02 --> 15.92
 It can pick soft fruit, like strawberries.

5
16.76 --> 18.78
 Now there's already a lot of automation on farms.

6
19.26 --> 21.06
 GPS guided tractors, for example.

7
21.54 --> 23.08
 But nothing quite like this.

8
23.62 --> 26.74
 Here we're trying to position something very delicate and small.

9
26.74 --> 30.68
 We can move to anywhere in 3D space and we can approach that point from any angle.

10
31.02 --> 34.5
 If you want to keep the strawberries intact, you need something smart and dexterous,

11
34.54 --> 35.88
 which is what these robots do.

12
36.72 --> 37.4
 Why do this?

13
37.98 --> 41.3
 It turns out it's getting harder and harder to find the human labour we need

14
41.3 --> 46.04
 to harvest all the strawberries made in a place like this huge, fancy strawberry farm.

15
46.62 --> 51.98
 The cost of fruit wasted last year in the UK purely because of our inability to recruit enough pickers

16
51.98 --> 53.8
 was about 35 million pounds.

17
53.8 --> 56.58
 That number is forecasted double again this year.

18
56.78 --> 60.88
 For me, this is a catastrophe and robotic automation can help enormously.

19
61.52 --> 65.2
 And as these robots get smarter and more dexterous, they can do more than that.

20
65.62 --> 68.66
 It can actually help us rethink everything we know about physical labour.

21
69.0 --> 73.9
 It takes a lot of effort, intelligence and bloody-minded perseverance to make it work.

22
75.02 --> 79.52
 This is Hard Recent, a series about rebuilding our world from scratch.

23
83.03999999999999 --> 86.96
 Farming is probably humanity's oldest industry,

24
87.24 --> 91.68
 but increasingly we're having to rethink all kinds of things.

25
92.7 --> 97.42
 This is Duncan. He is one of the co-founders of Dogtooth and his background is in farming.

26
97.74 --> 100.36
 So my background is not in agriculture at all.

27
100.68 --> 103.94
 My background is in machine learning and computer vision.

28
104.68 --> 108.46
 Oh, well the idea for Dogtooth came to Duncan while he was on a flight.

29
108.46 --> 110.44
 While he was sitting on a beach in Morocco.

30
111.32 --> 112.16
 Well, God damn it.

31
112.56 --> 116.3
 Morocco is an incredibly beautiful country, but it is covered in litter

32
116.3 --> 120.68
 and it just struck me that knowing what I knew about computer vision and machine learning,

33
120.9 --> 125.66
 actually the problem of identifying the litter on the beach using cameras was largely solved.

34
125.86 --> 130.12
 What we needed was a low-cost robot that could crawl their way around the beach

35
130.12 --> 131.74
 and pick up all the pieces of litter.

36
132.0 --> 135.18
 That underlying thinking took us in a slightly different direction.

37
135.74 --> 137.28
 It took them to a farm.

38
137.86 --> 138.86
 Hey, third time's the charm.

39
140.06 --> 144.72
 This is Ed, Duncan's co-founder, and he's going to show us how the robots get built.

40
144.92 --> 147.24
 Welcome to Dogtooth. This is our R&D workshop.

41
147.68 --> 150.6
 Our robots are made up of a few different technologies,

42
150.8 --> 153.24
 if you like electronics, mechanical and software,

43
153.46 --> 155.04
 and they're all brought together with this firmware

44
155.04 --> 157.28
 and this is where most of that integration work happens.

45
157.56 --> 158.64
 So here you'll see our clean room.

46
158.88 --> 161.62
 This is where we do all of our electronics integration work.

47
162.22 --> 166.14
 In order to make the robot work in such a dynamic environment like a farm,

48
166.5 --> 169.46
 the folks at Dogtooth couldn't use a lot of off-the-shelf technology.

49
169.8 --> 173.14
 They practically had to make every part of this robot from scratch.

50
173.52 --> 174.76
 So this is our commissioning area.

51
175.46 --> 177.92
 So on the right here, we do arm commissioning.

52
178.08 --> 181.14
 This robot arm, how much of this is custom designed by you?

53
181.26 --> 182.28
 All of it, unfortunately.

54
183.06 --> 183.94
 This is all of our stuff.

55
184.24 --> 188.04
 Yeah, these arms here are in different stages of commissioning.

56
188.04 --> 191.58
 The ones without any covers are on their initial test.

57
192.04 --> 194.16
 So once it's done, it's initial commissioning test.

58
194.42 --> 197.52
 It gets its covers put on and then it will run through a burn-in test.

59
197.7 --> 198.78
 And that takes about 16 hours.

60
199.3 --> 201.78
 So this is like C-3PO in Phantom Menace,

61
201.96 --> 203.54
 and then this is from A New Hope.

62
204.18 --> 204.6
 There you go.

63
205.34 --> 206.16
 I've never seen Star Wars.

64
206.7 --> 207.0
 What?

65
207.26 --> 208.66
 I know the reference where it's from,

66
208.84 --> 210.5
 but I don't know Star Wars, I'm afraid.

67
211.18 --> 212.18
 Oh my gosh.

68
212.86 --> 215.96
 Like the Star Wars movies, robots are not new.

69
215.96 --> 217.28
 They've been around for decades,

70
217.54 --> 219.96
 and there's very little excuse for not having Seaman.

71
220.44 --> 223.32
 But unlike C-3PO, robots in the real world

72
223.32 --> 225.32
 could only work in structured environments

73
225.32 --> 226.88
 with very tight tolerances.

74
227.6 --> 229.22
 In other words, nothing like a farm.

75
229.76 --> 232.54
 Is this like driving with a PlayStation joystick?

76
232.94 --> 233.76
 Exactly right, yeah.

77
233.98 --> 236.88
 So my wasted teenage years weren't so wasted.

78
237.58 --> 238.14
 Seaman.

79
238.46 --> 241.22
 So this is one of our fourth generation robots.

80
241.7 --> 243.42
 The nice thing about our arms

81
243.42 --> 245.38
 is that they are super flexible.

82
245.38 --> 247.04
 It's got six degrees of freedom,

83
247.52 --> 249.18
 and at any given joint,

84
249.7 --> 251.52
 the actual ability of the arms

85
251.52 --> 254.04
 rotate way more than 360 degrees.

86
254.7 --> 256.24
 In this pic ahead here, you'll see

87
256.24 --> 258.54
 a pair of cameras and a bunch of LEDs.

88
258.9 --> 260.2
 The LEDs allow us to pick at night.

89
260.98 --> 262.82
 The cameras allow us to see the fruit in 3D.

90
263.2 --> 264.28
 And in the center here,

91
264.76 --> 266.46
 we have our inspection system

92
266.46 --> 268.0
 where once we pick the berry,

93
268.22 --> 270.1
 we can suspend it into this chamber,

94
270.44 --> 272.64
 got cameras so we can view the berry all around.

95
272.88 --> 273.78
 Nice consistent lighting.

96
273.78 --> 276.0
 Pick up 17 different types of defects.

97
276.4 --> 278.02
 And so we know whether to put it into a way-shoot

98
278.02 --> 279.68
 or into a punnet ready for retail.

99
279.98 --> 280.76
 What are you guys calling?

100
281.08 --> 281.32
 Punnets.

101
281.54 --> 281.92
 Punnets?

102
282.1 --> 282.24
 Yeah.

103
283.38 --> 284.9
 You guys have crazy names for things.

104
285.22 --> 287.68
 I think in US they're clam shells, right?

105
287.94 --> 288.54
 That sounds right.

106
288.82 --> 288.96
 Yeah.

107
289.62 --> 291.3
 Or just the boxer strawberries coming.

108
291.52 --> 291.88
 Yeah, sure.

109
292.16 --> 293.82
 So here's our polytunnel.

110
294.0 --> 295.52
 We put this up about three years ago.

111
295.84 --> 296.96
 And we're actually, it turns out,

112
297.12 --> 297.92
 all right at growing strawberries.

113
298.72 --> 300.86
 For a bunch of engineers, we're going all right.

114
300.86 --> 303.52
 So the first question I have as someone from the United States,

115
303.78 --> 305.6
 I've never seen a strawberry farm

116
305.6 --> 307.62
 this at arm's height.

117
308.12 --> 308.24
 Yeah.

118
308.4 --> 309.14
 It's right all the way.

119
309.22 --> 310.86
 It already feels like a better design,

120
310.86 --> 312.18
 just from a picking standpoint for humans.

121
312.26 --> 312.96
 Absolutely is.

122
313.42 --> 315.04
 Here in the UK, we tend to use

123
315.04 --> 317.38
 quite modern tabletop growing systems.

124
317.56 --> 319.4
 Approximately the right height to make it easy

125
319.4 --> 322.18
 for human workers to pick the fruit.

126
324.46 --> 326.82
 Obviously about the robot is it's got to be super rugged.

127
327.08 --> 328.34
 We're here on a nice flat farm

128
328.34 --> 329.1
 in the middle of Cambridgeshire.

129
329.38 --> 329.52
 Right.

130
329.52 --> 332.26
 We also operate these on very steep hillsides

131
332.26 --> 333.66
 when it's raining cats and dogs

132
333.66 --> 335.08
 and there's mud everywhere.

133
335.56 --> 336.9
 So we've got super rugged tracks.

134
337.28 --> 339.42
 Moving on up, you've got the two robot arms

135
339.42 --> 341.0
 which are doing all the clever bits.

136
341.46 --> 343.84
 The arms of the robot have these stereo cameras

137
343.84 --> 345.24
 and they use computer vision

138
345.24 --> 347.32
 to navigate this complex environment.

139
347.78 --> 349.82
 Find a stock and gently remove the fruit.

140
351.70000000000005 --> 353.2
 So welcome to the glasshouse.

141
353.46 --> 355.82
 Up here, you'll see us starting to run robots.

142
356.02 --> 358.22
 We've got six running today, I believe.

143
358.22 --> 360.16
 What we're essentially doing is just looking

144
360.16 --> 361.82
 for clean lines on which to pick

145
361.82 --> 363.84
 so that we're maximising our chance

146
363.84 --> 365.22
 of getting our target berry.

147
365.66 --> 366.7
 We've also got a clear vector

148
366.7 --> 368.48
 to the stalk that I interested in.

149
368.9 --> 369.92
 I'll pick along that vector,

150
370.36 --> 372.44
 grab a stalk, grip and cut it

151
372.44 --> 373.62
 and then I'll take it to the

152
373.62 --> 374.78
 inspection chamber here.

153
375.0 --> 377.38
 You'll see a few flashes as it images it all around

154
377.38 --> 379.52
 then it will decide which planet to put it in.

155
379.76 --> 381.02
 Well it's interesting because on this one

156
381.02 --> 382.52
 it looks like it picked the right berry.

157
383.08000000000004 --> 384.36
 It just was attached to it.

158
384.62 --> 385.9
 Yeah, so you'll see here

159
385.9 --> 387.0
 it just picked a little bit high

160
387.0 --> 389.4
 and so I've got another berry in with it.

161
389.62 --> 389.68
 Right.

162
389.74 --> 390.82
 I'll pick that up in the inspection chamber

163
390.82 --> 392.18
 and so it's put it into a punnet here

164
392.18 --> 393.5
 for us to sort through it,

165
393.84 --> 394.64
 pick up a good berry

166
394.64 --> 396.38
 and leave a bad berry behind.

167
397.44 --> 398.4
 Just to be clear,

168
398.7 --> 401.36
 this robot won't mean the end of humans on farms

169
401.36 --> 402.74
 so there will still be plenty

170
402.74 --> 405.4
 of dating profiles on farmersonly.com.

171
405.84 --> 407.28
 The dream I think is that robots

172
407.28 --> 409.26
 can perform some of the dull tasks

173
409.26 --> 411.06
 and allow us to focus on the things

174
411.06 --> 413.2
 that we as human beings are uniquely good at.

175
413.38 --> 414.14
 So here at Dogtooth,

176
414.2 --> 415.9
 the goal isn't to replace human workers

177
415.9 --> 417.84
 but the workforce for something

178
417.84 --> 420.22
 like strawberry picking which is a seasonal job.

179
420.44 --> 421.94
 It's very difficult to make sure

180
421.94 --> 424.14
 that we're getting enough workers across the UK.

181
424.36 --> 426.4
 So the way that we view it is that

182
426.4 --> 428.38
 the robots we can create will be very good

183
428.38 --> 430.32
 at doing a very specific task.

184
430.68 --> 433.3
 For us we look to incorporate our robots

185
433.3 --> 435.5
 with human workers so the humans can do

186
435.5 --> 437.04
 the thinking that the robot can't.

187
437.48 --> 439.94
 For now, humans will supervise teams

188
439.94 --> 441.68
 of these robots as they harvest berries

189
441.68 --> 444.26
 and the robots for now are a bit slower

190
444.26 --> 445.36
 than the humans at picking.

191
445.88 --> 447.72
 How long does it typically take for one to finish a row?

192
451.18 --> 455.0
 One of the things that we haven't prioritised yet

193
455.0 --> 456.5
 is making them go faster.

194
456.8 --> 458.88
 With these robots, we've gone for the

195
458.88 --> 460.06
 strobe but steady approach.

196
460.56 --> 463.06
 The maximum speed that we have around these robots

197
463.06 --> 465.82
 is about a quarter of the speed of an average person.

198
466.12 --> 467.26
 The next generation we're working on

199
467.26 --> 468.48
 will be more like half the speed,

200
468.64 --> 470.74
 maybe even more like three-quarters of the speed of a person

201
470.74 --> 473.1
 but because they come on for multiple shifts in a day

202
473.1 --> 475.44
 they're able to pick off just as much fruits

203
475.44 --> 477.72
 as a person can over a course of the day.

204
478.02 --> 479.62
 Another interesting difference is that

205
479.62 --> 481.66
 these robots don't grab the berry itself.

206
482.1 --> 483.2
 They pick from the stem.

207
483.8 --> 485.84
 This has the benefit of making the robot

208
485.84 --> 487.04
 a little bit less complex

209
487.04 --> 489.86
 but mainly it avoids the problem of bruising

210
489.86 --> 492.32
 and prevents the spread of fungus or other pests.

211
493.0 --> 494.5
 So as someone who buys a lot of strawberries

212
494.5 --> 496.6
 how do I know whether it has been picked by a robot?

213
496.82 --> 498.52
 On the end of each stalk you can see

214
498.52 --> 499.78
 this one which has just been picked here.

215
500.08 --> 502.12
 There's a little crimp mark just below the top

216
502.12 --> 504.82
 and that's where it's been held onto by the robot.

217
506.06 --> 507.6
 Ironically, these robots were made

218
507.6 --> 509.8
 to supplement a dwindling migrant workforce

219
509.8 --> 512.84
 but now they themselves are a migrant workforce.

220
513.5 --> 516.22
 So these are designed to work out of shipping containers.

221
516.62 --> 518.78
 We've currently got 16 of these in our shipping container

222
518.78 --> 519.72
 on their way to Tasmania.

223
520.28 --> 522.4
 These robots spend part of the year in Australia

224
522.4 --> 524.32
 but it's far more affordable

225
524.32 --> 526.64
 and environmentally friendly to ship robots

226
526.64 --> 527.9
 to Australia than humans.

227
528.88 --> 531.0
 And believe me, no one knows more

228
531.0 --> 533.16
 about how expensive it is to ship humans

229
533.16 --> 534.94
 to Australia than the English.

230
536.82 --> 538.2
 Robotics will make it profitable

231
538.2 --> 539.94
 to grow crops in more places

232
539.94 --> 541.76
 closer to where they're consumed

233
541.76 --> 544.06
 and that will reduce the carbon impact

234
544.06 --> 545.9
 and make delicious fresh produce

235
545.9 --> 547.04
 available to more people.

236
547.78 --> 550.12
 I was talking to some farmers yesterday

237
550.12 --> 552.74
 about whether this, you know,

238
552.9 --> 554.32
 robotics was a revolution or not

239
554.32 --> 557.24
 and I was saying it's not a revolution, it's a transition.

240
557.54 --> 559.24
 If you look at it now, the difference between

241
559.24 --> 560.74
 a modern farm and a farm

242
561.32 --> 563.26
 150 years ago is huge

243
563.26 --> 564.68
 but that didn't happen overnight.

244
564.92 --> 567.18
 We're just at the start of really applying

245
567.18 --> 569.74
 this kind of idea of intelligent robotics

246
569.74 --> 572.52
 to real-world tangible problems

247
572.52 --> 574.58
 and it's a really exciting journey we're all on.

248
578.14 --> 578.9
 Very cool.

249
581.0600000000001 --> 583.18
 So picture a scenario where robots

250
583.18 --> 585.52
 are involved in harvesting all of our produce.

251
586.12 --> 587.42
 The economics of food production

252
587.42 --> 588.66
 would be totally different.

253
589.62 --> 591.42
 Robots like this wouldn't just address

254
591.42 --> 593.94
 labor shortages, they'd address food shortages

255
593.94 --> 595.64
 by allowing precision agriculture

256
595.64 --> 598.14
 in places where it just wasn't possible before.

257
598.58 --> 599.5
 I don't think most people realize

258
599.5 --> 600.82
 how big of a problem food waste is.

259
601.22 --> 602.4
 It's 40% in the UK.

260
602.78 --> 604.84
 We throw 40% away of fresh produce.

261
605.72 --> 606.86
 It's nuts, isn't it?

262
607.7 --> 609.8
 So each robot is also going to be harvesting

263
609.8 --> 612.28
 about 40 gigabytes of data every day.

264
612.66 --> 614.9
 We're now working, building that together

265
614.9 --> 617.82
 with WeatherToolCosm to a yield prediction model

266
617.82 --> 619.42
 where we can tell the future

267
619.42 --> 622.04
 and understand not just what's ready to pick today

268
622.04 --> 623.86
 but what will be ready in two weeks' time.

269
624.32 --> 626.44
 And the intelligence that allows a robot

270
626.44 --> 628.56
 to work in an inconsistent environment

271
628.56 --> 630.6
 like a farm will eventually develop

272
630.6 --> 632.7
 into the kind of intelligence that enables them

273
632.7 --> 635.2
 to work in other dynamic, inconsistent places

274
635.2 --> 637.6
 like stores, hospitals or homes.

275
637.6 --> 641.06
 In theory, there's almost no physical job

276
641.06 --> 642.16
 a robot couldn't do.

277
643.04 --> 644.78
 So where does that leave humans?

278
646.24 --> 647.6
 I think the hope is that

279
647.6 --> 649.68
 automation will allow us to create

280
649.68 --> 651.82
 more desirable jobs for people.

281
652.34 --> 654.06
 But I think there is also a threat.

282
654.84 --> 656.44
 The danger I see is that we use

283
656.44 --> 659.38
 robotic automation to displace people,

284
659.66 --> 661.82
 to rob people of the opportunity

285
661.82 --> 663.22
 to earn a livelihood.

286
664.44 --> 666.1
 Intelligence applied to robots

287
666.1 --> 668.28
 has the potential to completely change

288
668.28 --> 670.4
 everything we know about physical labor.

289
671.1 --> 673.04
 If we do it wrong, it could cause

290
673.04 --> 675.44
 the greatest labor disruption in human history.

291
676.24 --> 677.6
 But if we do it right,

292
678.06 --> 679.98
 it will free up an even greater source

293
679.98 --> 682.14
 of adaptable intelligence with the capacity

294
682.14 --> 683.18
 to shape the world.

295
684.12 --> 684.42
 Us.

296
684.98 --> 686.28
 I think the interesting observation is that

297
686.28 --> 689.14
 we're teaching robots to perform functions

298
689.14 --> 692.06
 that we as human beings find really easy.

299
692.42 --> 695.1
 As people, we are remarkably good

300
695.1 --> 697.1
 at performing what are actually

301
697.1 --> 698.64
 incredibly complex tasks.

302
699.02 --> 700.18
 It should make us celebrate

303
700.18 --> 703.22
 the beauty and capability of humanity.

304
706.02 --> 707.46
 I'm from America. What's a kilo?

305
708.06 --> 709.34
 A kilo is half a pound.

306
709.56 --> 710.6
 2.2 pounds to a kilo.

307
710.84 --> 712.64
 I only use metric system when I'm buying drugs.

308
714.36 --> 716.04
 Never bought a kilo of drugs.

309
716.24 --> 716.84
 Just to be clear.
