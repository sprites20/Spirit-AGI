A drug must be lipophilic (lipid soluble) in order to pass through biological membranes this is true because biological membranes are made up of a lipid bilayer (phospholipids etc.) Once the drug reaches the blood circulation it is then distributed throughout the body and being more concentrated in highly perfused organs. \\nAdministration, drug policy and safety\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nDrug policy\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nMain article:\\nDrug policy\\nIn the\\nUnited States\\n, the\\nFood and Drug Administration\\n(FDA) is responsible for creating guidelines for the approval and use of drugs.",
