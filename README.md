Unfortunately, the Facebook and Google search requires a separate main thread to run, requiring another subprocess call and returning the stdout, making it extremely difficult to integrate into mobile apps without a proper browser. I had put a map into it, to the judges and users, I am very thankful for the time considered and I'm very honored to be part of this hackathon. For any security purposes, it saves the cookie for the login credentials somewhere and I am not stealing any of it. I really apologize for any inconvenience of unable to host a website, I soon hope I am able to make an API and then host a chatbot somewhere.

Do
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then

```
python main.py
```
or

```
python somekivybox.py
```
