Unfortunately, the Facebook and Google search requires a separate main thread to run, requiring another subprocess call and returning the stdout, making it extremely difficult to integrate into mobile apps without a proper browser. I had put a map into it, to the judges and users, I am very thankful for the time considered and I'm very honored to be part of this hackathon. For any security concerns, it saves the cookie for the login credentials somewhere and I am not stealing any of it. I apologize for any inconvenience of being unable to host a website, I soon hope I can make an API and then host a chatbot somewhere.

I know that I'm unlikely to win at this moment due to product quality and the pace I'm going, but I am determined to start a business, despite it being hard as I am not ready to be employed just yet. I am trying my hardest to make it. May we all reach our goals and just enjoy life.
